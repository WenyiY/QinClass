					My persona is about a student and a professor who both want to have something 
					that can encourage students to ask question or answer questions in class.
					For how to solving that problem, I found out a way which is to make an app
					that allow students and professors to communicate easier in class.

				<p class="main_text" align="left">
					During the research I found out the reason why most of the students are afraid of 
					raise their hands in class. Once one student raise his hand, he will attracts others 
					attentions and soon become the distinct one, which makes a student nervous. 
					Moreover, if one student have question about something and wants to ask, he will 
					think that probably other students all know how to solve it already so it's a shame
					to ask this foolish question in case other laugh at him.
					Or the student might think the question he asked will slow down the class speed,
					and will cause trouble to others, which is a main thought among the research.
					But what if students know whether his question is foolish or not before he asked 
					professor? So I came up an idea with an app that all students can see the questions
					other post and "like" the question if they have the same concern. Then professor can select
					the most popular question among all to answer.
