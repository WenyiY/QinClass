					Emily is taking Math242 right now. The professor is teaching really fast that she has questions about the part professor just finished teaching. She feels lost at what the is professor teaching right now.
					 She wants to raise her hand, but she looks around and seems other students are paying attention in the lesson. She feel it’s going to be really awkward if she raised her hand right now. 
					 She then got an idea that she will try to use the app released recently that might solve her problem.
